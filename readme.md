## About me as a dev

I'm a JavaScript/TypeScript enthusiast, I love everything about it, from its
ecosystem to its tools. And open-source is how I consume and share content, my
GitHub [@iurypiva](https://github.com/iurypiva) is always being updated.

I always like to take a look _under the hood_ of every tool that I use, and I've
got quite good with TypeScript's type manipulation. But despite my passion for
JS I'm more often than not learning and using new languages and technologies.

### Technologies:

- TypeScript
- Git
- CSS
- Runtimes: Node.js and Deno
- Other programming languages: Ruby, Python, Rust
- Shell: Bash, Zsh
- Testing tools: Cypress, Jest, Deno.test, my own test frameworks, etc
- Containers and daemons: Docker, Caprover, pm2
- Server configuration: Linux servers, nginx, ssh,
- Cloud providers: AWS, GCP, Azure, IBM Cloud, Deno Deploy, Heroku, Digital
  Ocean
- CI/CD pipelines: Github actions, custom webhooks and git hooks
- NoSql databases: GraphQL, document based, key-value based, collection based,
  mongodb, dynamodb, etc
- SQL databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server.
- State management: Redux, MOBX, custom store designing.
- Memory, File and realtime databases too such as: Redis, sqlite, DsDDB
- Concepts: canvas, SSR, data structures, algorithms, Sockets, Streams, Buffers,
  parsers/compilers, web protocols, page load times, perfomance and profilers,
  SEO, caching strategies, memory management, iterators, serverless
- Frameworks and libs: Angular, React, Vue, Webpack, Babel, lodash
- Web3: Completed the cryptozombies NFT tutorial (lol) with Solidity and Ethereum blockchain

## About me as a human

I'm the "funny guy", always in a good mood but I will gently let you know when
I'm not at my best.

I like to talk to people and getting to know more about them. I hate wasting
time but I love spending quality time with family and friends.

My values are **empathy**, **growth** and **transparency**.

I believe that feedbacks are the fastest way to improve oneself. In every aspect
that I can I try to expose my way of thinking, goals and motivation. On the same
way I bring up my doubts, questions and uncertanties the clearest way possible.

I'm a very energetic and fast-paced person, I get things done, even if that
means not getting it right on the first try.

## Education

> ##### 2015 -> 2019 (Unfinished*)
> #### Computer Science at UNESC

\* I had to move out of the city and had to stop at the last semester.

## Experience

> ##### 2021 -> 2022 (current)
>
> #### Makepath
>
> ##### Full stack dev
>
> Worked on a [CZI](https://chanzuckerberg.com) grant for the open source data visualization library `Bokeh` that added [LaTeX capabilities to the library](https://blog.bokeh.org/bokeh-2-4-6f8a842dfb4f). The tech stack was TypeScript and Python and the code quality, tests and CI/CD of the whole repo was flawless! An another awesome project I'm working on is an Investment Advisor platform using Vue on the front-end, Nodejs on the main api and Deno for the integrations.

> ##### 2020 -> 2021
>
> #### Softplan
>
> ##### Front-end dev
>
> Worked on a huge governmental system with complex integrations and multiple developers. I helped develop a central React design system that was used in all projects but mostly hands down front-end work.

> ##### 2019 -> 2020
>
> #### Dooile Tech
>
> ##### Full stack dev
>
> Worked with Beacon BLE proximity technology, design and architeture of the
> whole mobile applications with android and IOs native and React Native hybrid
> technologies, as well as the servers (AWS, Terraform and NodeJS) and
> dashboards (React).

> ##### 2019 -> 2019
>
> #### Berlitz Corp
>
> ##### Full stack TypeScript dev
>
> My first fully remote position, the teams' office was split between Perth and
> Sydney both in Australia while I was living in Brazil, async communications
> and transparency were the key to make it work. The product was a brand new
> multitenant platform for their learning centres. I worked with AWS Amplify,
> Lambda, CodePipeline, React and NodeJS to design and create the UI kit and
> integrations between the Salesforce API and an Apollo GraphQL server.

> ##### 2018 -> 2019
>
> #### WiZED e-tickets
>
> ##### Freelancer full stack TypeScript dev
>
> Joined the team with the mission to create the TS code guide, dev enviroment
> best practices and automations, I got to work on very interesting projects and
> challenges that included technologies like smart contracts, blockchain,
> cryptocurrencies payment systems, cloud functions, realtime databases,
> serverless and page performance and cost efficiency.

> ##### 2017 -> 2018
>
> #### Simples Dental
>
> ##### Full stack dev
>
> My first tech startup, I learned a lot about product development and all the
> areas around it. Got to interact with incredible devs that inspire me to this
> day. I worked on the front-end with AngularJS but mostly on integrations with
> NodeJS and AWS tools. I helped creating the strategy to migrate the codebase
> from AngularJS to Angular 2 and JS to TS. I got to be responsible for an
> entire product which was a templated static website generator.

> ##### 2015 -> 2016
>
> #### Manchester Química do Brasil
>
> ##### IT technician and web developer
>
> This is where I started on the web dev life, with PHP, HTML, CSS, JS and SQL.
> Without a single framework I got to build strong fundamentals on the
> languagues I used. I was responsible for creating the reports dashboard on the
